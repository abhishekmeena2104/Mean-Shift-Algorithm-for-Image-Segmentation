# Mean-Shift-Algorithm-for-Image-Segmentation
>In this work i implemented the Mean Shift Image Segmentation method.  
>>>Mean shift clustering is a non-parametric kernel density estimation technique that clusters points based on repeated  updation of the mean.  
>>>Used a kernel based on joint distance using the color and (x,y) locations. 
Evaluated different   kernels for image segmentation. Also checked and evaluated the effect of the b#####Reference paper: Comaniciu, Dorin; Peter Meer (May 2002). "Mean Shift: A Robust Approach Toward Feature Space Analysis".
